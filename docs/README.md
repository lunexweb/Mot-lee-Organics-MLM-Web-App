# Project Documentation

This folder contains milestone notes and completion summaries for past phases of the project. These files are informational only and are not required for the application to run.

- PHASE-2-COMPLETE.md — Phase 2 summary (user dashboard & products)
- PHASE-3-COMPLETE.md — Phase 3 summary (team & commissions)
- PHASE-4-COMPLETE.md — Phase 4 summary (admin panel)

If you prefer a lean repository, you may delete any of these documents. They are kept here for historical context and onboarding.
